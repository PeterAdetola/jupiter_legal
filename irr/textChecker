I value a workplace culture that prioritizes clear communication, accountability, and a shared commitment to excellence. Throughout my career—particularly in high-stakes, data-driven roles in the U.S. Army—I’ve thrived in structured environments where expectations are clearly defined, tools are provided for success, and performance is recognized and rewarded. These principles are reflected in Akina Pharmacy’s adoption of the Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS), which resonates with how I’ve been trained to operate.

Akina’s emphasis on core values like Excellence Always and Called to Serve aligns with my dedication to quality assurance and data integrity, especially when dealing with sensitive information. I’m also drawn to the culture of growth and support, as it mirrors the collaborative and mission-focused teams I've led and been a part of. I see Akina as a place where my proactive mindset, attention to detail, and commitment to serving others can contribute meaningfully to both patient care and operational excellence.
