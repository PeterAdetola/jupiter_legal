faqs:
    - question: Will I need to sign the contract in person?

    - question: How long does it take to draft a contract?
      answer:   The timeline for drafting a contract will depend on the complexity of the agreement. Typically, simple contracts can be drafted within a week, while more complex agreements may take longer.
