    A Certificate of Occupancy (C of O) is a legal document that proves ownership of real estate and grants the holder the right to occupy, develop, or build on the property.
    In many jurisdictions, a C of O is required for real estate transactions, including buying and selling, mortgages, and construction. Without a valid C of O, a property may be considered illegal, which could result in fines, demolition, or other legal action.
